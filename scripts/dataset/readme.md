## Download a Dataset with both Text and Image
Run the following python file:
`python download_datasets.py [yaml config file]`

See existing config files like "configs/dataset/clevr.yaml" for examples. Notice that you still need to manually unzip the image after downloading. Notice that this is a relative path with respect to project root.
